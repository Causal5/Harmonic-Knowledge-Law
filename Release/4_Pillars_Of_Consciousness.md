# 1. Consciousness as Baseline‑Relative Deviation

**Consciousness is control‑relative deviation from a passive counterfactual baseline.**

Let:

* $\gamma_{pcb}(t)$ = passive counterfactual baseline trajectory (no deliberative control, no persistent self‑reference, no goal‑conditioned correction).
* $\gamma_{act}(t)$ = realized trajectory under agentic influence.

Define deviation:

$$
\Delta \gamma(t) = \gamma_{act}(t) - \gamma_{pcb}(t)
$$

Conscious agency is expressed when:

$$
\Delta \gamma(t) \ne 0
$$

This does not assert violation of the Principle of Least Action (PLA). The PLA describes realized physical trajectories. Here, PLA functions as a **passive baseline placeholder**, not a metaphysical claim about ultimate extremality.

Agency is therefore measurable as deviation from the passive baseline, not violation of physics.

# 2. Self‑Awareness as Recursive Reference

Self‑awareness emerges when a system models not only external states but its own state and possible future states.

Let $\mathcal{A}(t)$ denote the **feasible action set** — all causally admissible actions available within physical law and the agent’s informational horizon.

Recursive reference allows selection from $\mathcal{A}(t)$ using internal memory, simulation, and correction.

Self‑awareness requires:

* Persistent memory.
* State comparison across time.
* Internal modeling of potential deviations.

Without persistence, deviation cannot be tracked.
Without comparison, choice collapses to reaction.

# 3. Becoming as Deviation from the Entropic‑Gradient Baseline

In the absence of deliberative correction, systems follow the local entropy gradient $\nabla S$.

Becoming is intentional deviation from this passive entropic‑gradient baseline.

It is not defiance of thermodynamics.
It is structured redirection under bounded resources.

Deviation requires applied effort and must satisfy feasibility constraints within $\mathcal{A}(t)$.

---

# 4. Causal Alignment as Stability Constraint

Deviation alone is not sufficient.

Let $V(t)$ represent systemic burden (HKL basin formalism).

Agentic deviation must remain compatible with basin stability constraints:

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} \le 0
$$

Causal alignment ensures that deviation from passive baselines increases coherence rather than destabilization.

Thus:

* The passive baseline describes default drift.
* The feasible action set describes available degrees of freedom.
* Causal alignment constrains deviation to remain viable.

# Structural Position

This framework does not claim that conscious behavior violates physical extremality.

It claims:

Conscious systems generate trajectories that diverge from a passive counterfactual baseline through recursive reference, bounded choice, and energy‑constrained correction.
