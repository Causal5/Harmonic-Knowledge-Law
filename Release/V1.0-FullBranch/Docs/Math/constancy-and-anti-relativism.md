# Constancy and Anti-Relativism (Formal Scaffold)

## Goal
Show that meaningful variability (change, dynamics, comparison, measurement) presupposes constancy (invariants), and that any attempt at total relativism collapses into self-contradiction or triviality.

## Definitions
- **System**: a set of states S with relations/operations.
- **Observation / Measurement**: a mapping M: S → V into a value space V.
- **Invariant**: a property I(s) preserved under a transformation T (e.g., I(T(s)) = I(s)).
- **Comparability**: two observations are comparable only if there exists a stable reference that makes equality/ordering non-arbitrary.

## Core Claim (skeleton)
1) To say “X varies” requires:
   - a stable identity for “X” across time/context (constancy of reference), and
   - a stable rule for “varies” (constancy of comparison/metric).

2) If *all* references and rules are relative, then:
   - statements lose determinate truth conditions (collapse into “true-for-me”),
   - disagreement becomes non-contact (no shared criterion),
   - the claim “all is relative” cannot be asserted non-relatively (self-undermining).

## Lemma A — Measurement requires invariants
Any nontrivial measurement requires at least one invariant:
- units, scale, or ordering rule
- identity conditions for what is being measured
- transformation stability (re-measuring must relate coherently)

## Lemma B — Total relativism is performatively inconsistent
If “all claims are relative” is meant universally, it asserts a non-relative scope condition → contradiction.
If it is meant relatively, it has no binding force outside its frame.

## Gödel (optional placement)
Gödel’s incompleteness: sufficiently expressive formal systems contain truths not provable within the system, requiring meta-level reference.
This supports the need for external constancies / meta-criteria; it does *not* imply “everything is subjective.”
