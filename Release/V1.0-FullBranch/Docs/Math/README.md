# Math Appendix (Working)

This folder contains the formal mathematical scaffolding that supports the core HKL / Causal Ethics arguments.

## Navigation

- **constancy-and-anti-relativism.md** — core argument: variability requires constancy; formal invariants are unavoidable.
- **formulas-catalog.md** — a living index of formulas, definitions, and symbol tables used across the project.

## Conventions

- Prefer explicit definitions over implied meaning.
- Keep assumptions enumerated.
- When introducing a symbol, add it to the catalog.
- Separate **definition**, **lemma**, **claim**, **proof sketch**, **proof**.

> This appendix is intentionally modular so the main narrative can remain readable while still being fully grounded.
