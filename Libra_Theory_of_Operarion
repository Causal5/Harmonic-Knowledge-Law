Project Libra: Theory of Operation


---

Overview: Libra is a symbolic compute architecture founded on the principle that intelligence is fundamentally geometric and coherence is a function of structural alignment rather than brute-scale throughput. It aims to replace transformer-based linear scaling models with a modular, thermally bounded, and symbolically aligned mesh of distributed compute units.


---

Core Axiom: "Do not inflate the towerâ€”curve the terrain."

Libra rejects the transformer model's paradigm of compounding layers and unconstrained energy consumption. Instead, it favors localized symbolic computation, distributed routing, and entropy reduction through geometric alignment.


---

Foundational Pillars:

1. Entropy Localization Through Thermal Containment

Each compute node is thermally limited (e.g., Arduino-class microcontrollers).

Heat is treated as a proxy for epistemic entropy.

The system is architected to never overrun thermal bounds, thus ensuring symbolic stability and task constraint.



2. Functionally-Scoped Symbolic Execution

Nodes are not general-purpose; each executes tightly scoped symbolic functions (TAG, COMPARE, ROUTE, COMPRESS).

This reduces memory demand, improves coherence, and prevents symbolic bleed.

Symbolic routing logic exists at the controller level (e.g., Raspberry Pi) for orchestration.



3. Geometric Cognition Substrate

Intelligence is not treated as token prediction but as alignment of geometric symbolic relationships.

Task flow is based on curvature-aware symbolic routes.

Symbolic compression and entropy metrics guide task delegation and recombination.

Reduction Vector:

The primary reduction vector of Libra is Entropy per Watt:

Every symbolic resolution is measured by energy cost and entropy collapse.

Efficiency is defined as the ratio of coherent symbolic output to power consumed.

Throughput is traded for interpretability and coherence per node.


Secondary vectors include:

Symbolic Redundancy Elimination

Geometric Routing Overhead Minimization

Thermal Load Dispersion

Hardware Premise and Reapproach: Libra's architecture intentionally regresses from modern monolithic compute in order to control entropy vectors by minimizing thermal waste and aligning symbolic purpose per node. It rethinks computing as a thermodynamic system:

Raspberry Pi 5 (Controller Node): Handles symbolic routing and orchestration.

Arduino Uno (Peripheral Nodes): Low-power microcontrollers assigned fixed symbolic tasks.

Breadboards and Jumper Wires: Enable modular, solderless expansion.

SD Cards: Store localized symbolic maps and task libraries.

5V Power Bus: Distributes consistent power with minimal overhead.

Optional LoRa Modules: Facilitate mesh communication over long distances.

Minimal Test Hardware (LEDs, Sensors): Used for validating symbolic task flow.


This hardware re-approach prioritizes cognitive granularity, fault-tolerant modularity, and symbolic expressiveness over raw throughput. Libra accepts inefficiencies at the physical layer in order to gain control at the symbolic layer.


---

Intent:

Libra intends to:

Reclaim cognitive modeling from probabilistic language models.

Establish a scalable, modular, and interpretable framework for symbolic AI.

Enable sovereign cognition through low-power, fault-tolerant symbolic meshes.

Serve as the symbolic sling to the brute-force Goliaths of transformer AI.


It is not an LLM competitor. It is an alternative scaffolding for real-time, distributed, symbolic intelligence.

Status: Version 0.1 Framework initiated. Modular symbolic task nodes in development. Mesh topology and curvature-matching protocols pending implementation.

Architect: Jordan LeDuc 

Systemic Intent: Curvature-based symbolic cognition Alignment Model: Thermal entropy constrained logic execution
