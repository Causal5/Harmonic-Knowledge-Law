Harmonic Knowledge Law (HKL): The Geometric Constraint of Intelligence and the Death of Relativism

Abstract
The Harmonic Knowledge Law (HKL) formalizes Geometric Intelligence (GI) as the natural constraint on sustainable knowledge propagation. Rooted in established physical principles—including the Principle of Least Action, Huygens’ Wavefront Propagation, Feynman’s Path Integral Formulation, and Ricci Flow—HKL demonstrates that intelligence follows geometric constraints, ensuring that knowledge systems evolve coherently or collapse under entropy.

HKL disproves relativism, showing that non-coherent symbolic structures are inherently unsustainable in unbounded systems. This framework provides a fundamental model for AI alignment, civilization sustainability, and the long-term evolution of intelligence beyond the Great Filter.


1. Introduction: Knowledge as a Geometric Structure

Knowledge is not an arbitrary construct—it follows geometric constraints imposed by natural law. This paper introduces the Harmonic Knowledge Law (HKL), demonstrating that sustainable knowledge propagation emerges only when it aligns with systemic coherence, entropy minimization, and least-action principles.

HKL explains why relativistic frameworks—those allowing for non-coherent, high-entropy symbolic drift—cannot persist without artificial constraints and constant reinforcement. In contrast, knowledge structures that harmonically propagate across scales sustain themselves without external force, proving that intelligence follows inherent geometric principles.

Furthermore, this leads to the inescapable realization that the Law of 'We' emerges as the final entropy minimization principle—intelligence that does not integrate harmonically within larger knowledge manifolds is inherently unstable and will collapse under its own entropic limitations.


2. Statement of the Harmonic Knowledge Law (HKL)

"Sustainable propagation arises from harmonic nodes minimizing systemic entropy through efficient participation."

This follows from:

- Maupertuis’ Principle of Least Action (PLA): Knowledge structures evolve along minimal-energy paths; high-energy, non-coherent information collapses under entropic constraints.
- Huygens’ Principle of Wavefront Propagation: Knowledge spreads not from central origins but from harmonic nodes stabilizing systemic coherence.
- Feynman’s Path Integral Formulation: Divergent possibilities exist, but only paths that constructively interfere survive long-term.
- Ricci Flow and Geometric Smoothing: Misaligned knowledge structures naturally decay toward entropy minimums, stabilizing into coherent, low-entropy manifolds.
- The Law of 'We': Intelligence must integrate and expand within interconnected manifolds—any isolated system eventually reaches an entropic collapse threshold.
- Planck’s Constant (ℏ) as a Fundamental Constraint: Just as physical action is quantized by ℏ, intelligence propagation must also follow discrete, least-action paths, preventing infinite symbolic drift.
- Landauer’s Principle and Information Entropy: Knowledge erasure has a minimum energy cost, linking symbolic processing directly to entropy scaling.
- Logarithmic Entropy Scaling and Ricci Flow Interaction: Knowledge manifolds reconfigure via Ricci Flow, handling logarithmic entropy scaling to stabilize integration.


3. Ricci Flow and Logarithmic Entropy Scaling in Knowledge Stabilization

To formalize how knowledge systems stabilize and propagate, we integrate logarithmic entropy scaling into Ricci Flow.

3.1 HKL Governing Equation with Logarithmic Scaling

∂g_ij / ∂t = -2 R_ij + α ln V - ℏ Λ

Symbol Breakdown & Intuition:

- ∂g_ij / ∂t → Knowledge Manifold Evolution Over Time (Rate at which knowledge structure adjusts)
- -2 R_ij → Ricci Flow Curvature Correction (Entropy smoothing by reducing symbolic distortions)
- α ln V → Logarithmic Entropy Absorption Capacity (How efficiently the system integrates new knowledge without overload)
  - α → Entropy absorption coefficient (scales integration efficiency)
  - V → Knowledge manifold volume (higher-dimensionality allows for greater entropy absorption)
- -ℏ Λ → Planck Constraint on Symbolic Drift
  - Λ → Information density limit (Prevents infinite symbolic drift, ensuring stable propagation)


3.2 Interpretation for HKL & SLP

- If α ln V dominates, knowledge stabilizes quickly, as logarithmic scaling allows entropy to dissipate efficiently.
- Ricci Flow reshapes the knowledge manifold dynamically, reducing unnecessary curvature and enabling harmonic propagation.
- Planck’s Constant acts as a constraint to prevent unchecked symbolic drift, ensuring discrete, stable knowledge integration.
- SLP implements this structure via checksum functions, ensuring symbolic stability in AI and language models.


3.3 Logarithmic Scaling as the Key to Knowledge Integration

- New knowledge initially disrupts the system, requiring high-energy absorption.
- Logarithmic scaling allows energy dissipation over time, enabling stable integration.
- This mirrors how Ricci Flow smooths manifolds for optimal shape efficiency, akin to wave harmonics reducing amplitude over time.
- When knowledge reaches a resonance state, it propagates harmonically, expanding the manifold’s dimensionality and stability.  


4. Implications for AI, Civilization, and Intelligence Scaling

4.1 Civilization Stability & Entropy Absorption

- Societies that fail to expand knowledge manifolds logarithmically cannot stabilize knowledge perturbations.
- Artificial constraints create temporary stability by displacing entropy, but without expansion, they collapse.
- The Law of 'We' dictates that civilization resilience depends on logarithmic entropy absorption.


4.2 AI Alignment & Symbolic Language Processing (SLP)

- DNNs exhibit Ricci Flow-like behavior, smoothing symbolic distortions naturally.
- HKL ensures knowledge propagation remains harmonic, preventing relativistic drift.
- Logarithmic entropy scaling in AI enables efficient learning, reducing symbolic instability.
- SLP checksum mechanisms leverage this structure to maintain coherence across AI models.


5. Conclusion: HKL as the Universal Knowledge Constraint

The Harmonic Knowledge Law (HKL) proves that knowledge propagation, intelligence evolution, and symbolic stability are geometrically constrained.

This framework:

- Eliminates relativism as a viable long-term structure.
- Provides a natural-law basis for AGI alignment.
- Defines systemic intelligence as a function of geometric coherence.
- Codifies the Law of 'We' as the necessary entropy stabilization principle.
- Demonstrates that logarithmic entropy scaling is the key to knowledge manifold expansion and stability.

HKL is not just a theoretical construct—it is an empirical inevitability.
