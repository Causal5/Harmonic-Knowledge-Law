# Harmonic Knowledge Law (HKL)

Welcome to the *Harmonic Knowledge Law (HKL)* repository—a framework for building harmonic intelligence systems that align human and AI actions with natural laws, ensuring systemic coherence and sustainability. This project integrates several key concepts:

- **Causal Ethics (CE)**: An ethical framework for aligning actions with natural laws.
- **Law of ‘We’**: The principle of interconnectedness, emphasizing systemic impact.
- **Geometric Intelligence (GI)**: A model of intelligence as a high-dimensional knowledge manifold.
- **Geometric Intelligence Learning Network (GILN)**: A networked system for human-AI collaboration.
- **Symbolic Language Processing (SLP)**: An advanced language processing approach for symbolic reasoning.
- **Harmonic Knowledge Law (HKL)**: A principle for harmonic scaling of intelligence, minimizing entropy.

## Project Structure

- **CorePrinciples/**: Core concepts and principles.
  - [The Law of ‘We’](CorePrinciples/Law_of_We_Causal_Ethics.md): The principle of interconnectedness.
  - [The Axis: Axiomatic Foundation of Causal Ethics](CorePrinciples/CausalEthicsAxis.md): The universal constant and cognitive exception grounding ethical decision-making.
  - [Glossary of Key Terms](CorePrinciples/Glossary.md): Definitions of core concepts.
- **src/**: Source code for the *GILN* implementation.
  - `human_node.py`: Defines human nodes in the *GILN* network.
  - `iif_evaluator.py`: Evaluates contributions using the *Integrated Intelligence Framework (IIF)*.
  - `giln_network.py`: Manages the human side of the *GILN* network.
  - `giln_ai.py`: Manages the AI side of the *GILN* network.
  - `test_giln_human.py`: Tests the human side of *GILN*.
  - `test_giln_combined.py`: Tests the integration of human and AI sides.
- **Validation.md**: Real-world evidence validating the frameworks (e.g., DeepSeek distillation).
